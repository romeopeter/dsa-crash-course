# Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course

Welcome to the **DSA Crash Course** repository! <br />
This project aims to help developers (me) master the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms through code implementations, exercises, and real-world projects.

## Components
- Detailed code implementations for common DSA topics.
- Weekly breakdown for easy learning.
- Real-world projects (e.g., Navigation System, Autocomplete).
- Exercises and solutions for practice.

## Course Outline
1. **Month 1**: Foundations (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
2. **Month 2**: Advanced Data Structures (Trees, Heaps)
3. **Month 3**: Graphs and Algorithms
4. **Month 4**: Algorithmic Paradigms (Divide and Conquer, DP, Greedy)
5. **Month 5**: Real-World Applications
6. **Month 6**: Capstone Projects

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/romeopeter/dsa-crash-course.git
   ```

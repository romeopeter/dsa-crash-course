# Foundation of Data Structure: Introduction to Complexity Analysis (7 - 14 Jan, 2025)

complexity analysis measures how an algorithm performs as the size of its inputs grows. It allows to:

- Predict Performance: Understand how the algorithm will behave for large inputs.
- Compare Algorithms: Choose the most efficient algorithm for a problem.
- Optimize Code: Reduce execution time and memory usage.

# key concept of Complexity Analysis

1. Big-O notation:
   Big 0-notation describe the _Upper bound_ of an algorithm growth rate. It measure the worst-case scenario.
   For instance:

- 0(1) - Constantine time (fastest)
- 0(log n) - logarithmic time
- 0(n) - Linear time
- 0(n log n) - Log-linear time
- 0(n<sup>2</sup>) - Quadratic time (slower)

Why Big-O? It abstracts away hardware differences and focuses on scalability.

2. Time Complexity:
   Measures the number of operations an algorithm performs relative to input size.

3. Space Complexity:
   Measures the additional memory the algorithm uses relative to input size.

# Why Is It Useful?

1. Helps design efficient algorithms.
2. Helps predicts system scalability.
3. Guides trade-offs between speed and memory.
4. Avoids bottlenecks in software solutions.

# When to use it?

1. When designing software design that handles large datasets.
2. To identify performance-critical section of the code
3. When comparing multiple algorithms for the same task.

# Code Samples

1. Constant Time Complexity: 0(1) <br />
   No matter the size of the input, the operation count remain constant. See `constant-time.py` for code.

2. Linear Time Complexity: 0(n) <br />
   The number of operation grows linearly with input size. See `linear-time.py` for code.

3. Quadratic Time Complexity: 0(n<sup>2</sup>) <br />
   Nested loops over the same data cause quadratic growth.. See `quadratic-time.py` for code.

4. Logarithmic Time Complexity: O(log n) <br />
   This often occurs in divide-and-conquer algorithms, like binary search. See `logarithmic-time.py` for code.

5. Space Complexity: 0(log n<sup>2</sup>) <br />
   See `space.py` for code.

# How to Analyze Complexity

1. Time Complexity:
- Look at loops (e.g., single loop = O(n), nested loop = O(nÂ²)).
- Check recursive calls (e.g., binary search = O(log n)).

2. Space Complexity: 
- Count additional data structures (e.g., arrays, dictionaries).

# Practice problem

Write a function to check if a list contains duplicates and analyze its complexity. <br />

<b>Analysis</b>
- Time Complexity of 0(n): Single loop through the array
- Space Complexity of 0(n): `Set` stores unique element

See `practice-problem.py` for code.

# Introduction to Complexity Analysis

complexity analysis measures how an algorithm performs as the size of its inputs grows. It allows to:
- Predict Performance: Understand how the algorithm will behave for large inputs.
- Compare Algorithms: Choose the most efficient algorithm for a problem.
- Optimize Code: Reduce execution time and memory usage.

# key concept of Complexity Analysis
1. Big-O notation
Big 0-notation describe the *Upper bound* of an algorithm growth rate. It measure the worst-case scenario.
For instance:
- `0(1)` - Constantine time (fastest)
- `0(log n)` - logarithmic time
- `0(n)` - Linear time
- `0(n log n)` - Log-linear time
- 0(n<sup>2</sup>) - Quadratic time (slower)
